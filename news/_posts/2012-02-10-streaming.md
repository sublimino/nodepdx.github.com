So it's Friday and you're coming to NodePDX tomorrow, right? Oh. [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)? You're still chillaxing in San Francisco? Waiting for the subway in NYC? Hanging out in a coffee shop in Amsterdam? Well fear not my fellow Nodistas, the entire conference will be streamed live and the talks will be recorded and available for later viewing. All of this is happening on the [NodePDX Livestream Channel]http://www.livestream.com/nodepdx](http://www.livestream.com/nodepdx)

Also, you may or may not have heard but [New Relic](http://newrelic.com) is sponsoring an open-bar, hosted happy-hour on Saturday night from 6-8pm at [Lotus](http://www.cegportland.com/lotushttp://www.cegportland.com/lotus). Come join us!

Sunday night we'll be heading over to [The Guild Public House](http://theguildpub.com/) for drinks. They are going to have my favourite 80's hacker movie, [War Games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames) on the big screen starting at 7pm, and you'll get a $1 off your draft beers just by showing your [NodePDX badge](http://twitpic.com/8i5uty). Complete with free wifi, some cool video games upstairs and a bartender that can mix a serious [Sazerac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sazerac)... What better way to relax after the conference? See you there Sunday night around 6:30pm!  

If you just can't wait and want to get in the mood early... Watch this [mesmerizing demo](http://nodepdx.github.com/assets/demo/demo.html] that [@thoward37](https://twitter.com/#!/thoward37) made in pure Javascript/HTML5. This will be rolling on the projector in between talks. Woot!

If you're a procrastinator like me (too much lazily evaluated coding)... It's not too late to [RSVP](http://lanyrd.com/2012/nodepdx/)!
