Description
-----------

Everyone talks about Node.js in terms of non-blocking I/O and creating a web service
or web site using JavaScript. But there is more to Node.js than just Sockets, ports, and protocols.
I'll explore some of the non-web exclusive uses of Node.js. Node can be a code compiler, an FTP server,
a continuous integration server, a mail server, a deployment server, or an IRC server. Node can provide
system reports, build and package your projects, and parse ePub books.
